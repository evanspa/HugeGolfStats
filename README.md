HugeGolfStats
=============

Developed around 2008, HugeGolfStats.com was a web application that allowed users to create an account, and record their golf scores and all sorts of data elements about their rounds (num putts, GIRs, fairways-hit, up/downs, etc). 

The web application is no longer deployed.  

The application is written in Java, and leverages the following stack:

+ Apache Struts - MVC framework
+ Hibernate - object/relational mapping framework
+ MySQL - storage
+ Spring Framework - inversion-of-control container
+ many others...

Perhaps at some point in the future I'll resurrect this project and modernize it (Javascript-driven client-side rendering for web front-end, high-availability NoSQL-based storage, REST-based services, mobile apps, etc).
